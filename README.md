1. Home Page

Fetch and display a list of SuperHeros (Characters) on the home page. Also create a search bar that will filter out the character based on search query. Suppose I type “bat” in the search box, it should show “batman”. 
[ API example https://gateway.marvel.com:443/v1/public/characters?ts=<time-stamp>&apikey=<public-key>&hash=<md5(ts+privateKey+publicKey)>]
Each search result of the superhero should have a favorite button, clicking on which superhero should be added to “My favorite superheroes” (a list).
On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).

2. Superhero Page

Should show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, photo, bio and other information provided by the API (comics, events, series, stories, etc).

3. My favourite superheroes Page

Display a list of all the favourite superheroes.
Make this list persistent (should have the same number of superheroes before and after closing the browser).
Remove from favourites button: Each superhero should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that superhero from the list.

Note:-
add cryptojs
1. npm install crypto-js
2. import like <script src="node_modules/crypto-js/crypto-js.js"></script> in html file.

above technique will work in local but not on github, so better use CDN
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/3.1.9-1/crypto-js.js"></script>
